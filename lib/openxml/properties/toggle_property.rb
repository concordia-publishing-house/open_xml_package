      # Toggle properties are no different in representation than on/off properties;
      # rather, the difference is in how they compose with one another (cf.
      # Section 17.7.3). It's helpful, then, to retain the concept, but entirely
      # unnecessary to duplicate implementation.
      # cf. Section A.6.9 of the spec, and Section A.7.9 of the transitional spec.
